#Luke Ephraim Viste's Portfolio

I am a computer engineering major at CSUF and plan to graduate within the four years of attending CSUF. I chose this becuase I never wanted to be different from what my parents want me to do and that's what still drives me to this day. Doing something I love give me passion to keep moving forward in life. There will be ups and downs on this path, but that's the fun of something I love. I love giving myself a challenge because it shows that I am capable of doing better.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 2, part 1
This was fun since it was my first real lab and expreience of coding again. At first glacne it looked hard, but when reading and understanding what to do it was easy. Trying to push and pull was hard at first because I didn't know we how until they taught me and from there on everything clicked on how things were done around here.

Lab 4, part 2
This was essentially the beginning of my graps on the fundamentals and more of computer science, which is why I love it so much. It was enjoyable, and because everyone knew what was doing on the lab was completed quickly, it was technically the easiest one I have done. My favorite was creating this small gmae and getting to play it

Lab 12, part 1
This was our last lab we did in the class. I got to understand what it means to really put in your knowledge of everything and put it to use. Messing wiht making a message and colors were really cool and easy to understand which is why this lab was fun to me.
